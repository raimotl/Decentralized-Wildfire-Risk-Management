# Decentralized Wildfire Risk Management

A blockchain-based platform for collaborative wildfire risk assessment, prevention, and emergency response coordination.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent ecosystem for wildfire risk management with the following key components:

- **Property Registration**: Immutable records of structures in fire-prone regions
- **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic calculation of wildfire vulnerability factors
- **Mitigation Tracking**: Verification of prevention measures implementation
- **Alert Distribution**: Efficient emergency notification management

## Smart Contracts

### Property Registration Contract
- Stores comprehensive property details with geospatial information
- Records structural characteristics relevant to fire resistance
- Maintains ownership and occupancy data for emergency coordination
- Links to historical fire incident data for the specific location

### Risk Assessment Contract
- Calculates dynamic risk scores based on multiple environmental factors
- Incorporates weather data, vegetation conditions, and topography
- Updates vulnerability assessments based on seasonal changes
- Provides transparent risk calculation methodologies for stakeholders

### Mitigation Tracking Contract
- Verifies implementation of recommended fire prevention measures
- Records defensible space creation and maintenance activities
- Tracks structural hardening improvements with verification mechanisms
- Enables community-wide prevention coordination and resource sharing

### Alert Distribution Contract
- Manages multi-channel emergency notifications based on threat levels
- Implements geographic targeting for precise evacuation instructions
- Records notification receipt confirmation with priority escalation
- Coordinates with emergency services for unified communication

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Preparedness**: Data-driven risk assessment for proactive mitigation
- **Community Coordination**: Transparent sharing of prevention resources and strategies
- **Rapid Response**: Optimized emergency notifications with verification mechanisms
- **Insurance Integration**: Verified mitigation efforts can inform coverage and premiums
- **Accountability**: Immutable records of prevention measures and compliance

## Getting Started

Detailed setup and implementation instructions will be provided in subsequent documentation.
